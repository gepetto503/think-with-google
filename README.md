# _Think With Google Mock Up_

#### _A re-build of a section of a thinkwithgoogle.com page, utilizing Bootstrap 3, June 2, 2017_

#### By _**Brendan Hanna**_

## Description

_This web page combines Bootstrap's grids with floats and custom media queries to create a responsive mock up of the "Latest trends and stories" section of the landing page of www.thinkwithgoogle.com (as the page looked on June 2nd, 2017). _

## Setup/Installation Requirements_

* _Clone project folder down from https://github.com/gepetto503/think-with-google _
* _open index.html in any browser_


## Known Bugs

_Not a bug per se but the featured images currently scale down on both axes by percentage, as opposed to the thinkwithgoogle section where they maintain a constant height but are cropped horizontally as they size down._

_Also, the images featured images are not intentionally positioned within their frames, they just fall where they lay.  Ultimately I would like to be able to center them within their frames_

_Additionally, I would like to apply a gradient over the images that darkens at the bottom so the white text is easier to read._

## Support and contact details

_If you run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns, contact me at gepetto503@gmail.com or make a contribution to the code!}_

## Technologies Used

_Just used Bootstrap's grid system, although the content inside of the articles (with the white backgrounds) are arranged with floats, etc., instead of nested grid elements._
